•	use for loops to iteratively execute a block of code
•	prematurely terminate loop execution using the break keyword
•	short-circuit execution of the current loop iteration using the continue keyword
•	effectively use nested loops
•	use enhanced for loops, also known as for-each loops, to iterate over arrays and iterable objects in Java
•	use while loops to control the number of times a block of code executes based on the value of a specific expression
•	use multiple loop variables to control the number of iterations in a while loop
•	identify common causes of infinite looping, such as incorrect use of the continue keyword
•	use the do-while loop control structure to ensure that the body of a loop is always executed at least once, regardless of the value of the loop variable
